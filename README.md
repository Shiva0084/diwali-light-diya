# Diwali Fireworks

A simple, elegant webpage that plays a festive fireworks video with audio to celebrate Diwali. The user is prompted to tap/click to start the animation and sound due to browser autoplay restrictions. After the video or a timeout, the page redirects to a wish page.

- Responsive full-screen fireworks video with audio.
- Overlay text with smooth fade-in animation.
- Skip button to jump directly to the wish page.
- Start overlay to enable user interaction for autoplay compliance.
